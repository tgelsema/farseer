"""The kind Python module exposes a number of classes that represent pieces of
metadata that are statistically meaningful. The Kind class is the abstract base
class for all other classes the kind module exposes. From Kind, the abstract
classes Type and Element are derived. A Type can be thought of as a set of
things; an Element can be thought of as a function from one set (its domain) to
another (its codomain). Operations acting on Types and Elements are given in
the term Python module. These operations can be used to construct a Term (see
the term Python module) that represents the internal structure of a Kind
instance, for instance: the internal structure of a dataset design

Functionality for translating the formal internal structure of a Kind (see also
the documentation of the term Python module) to xml form is also provided.

In an informal way, a Kind instance may (also) be associated with other Kind
instances; these are stored in an ordered dictionary which can be accessed as
the Kind instance attribute 'uses'. If a formal internal structure in xml
format of a Kind instance is required, the uses dictionary matches with it in
a natural way, preserving the order in which kind-id's occur in the xml string.

Functionality for constructing the formal structure (i.e., the 'constr' and the
'type' attributes of a Kind instance) from xml form is also provided.

Classes:
    Kind(Term):                  abstract base class for the hierarchy of Type
                                 and Element subclasses
    Type(Kind):                  abstract base class for metadata subclasses
                                 that can be thought of as sets
    Element(Kind):               abstract base class for metadata subclasses
                                 that can be thought of as functions 
    ObjectType(Type):            metadata class representing a set of entities
                                 of statistical interest. Examples: 'person'
                                 (a set of persons), 'household' (a set of
                                 households), 'business' (a set of businesses)
    Phenomenon(Type):            metadata class representing a set of similar,
                                 but abstract, observations of statistical
                                 interest; abstract in the sense that these
                                 observations come without data. Examples:
                                 'economic activity', 'duration', 'well-being'
    ObjectTypeRelation(Element): metadata class representing a functional
                                 relationship between two object types.
                                 Examples: 'member of' (between a 'person' and
                                 a 'household'), 'has father' (between a
                                 'person' and a 'person')
    Variable(Element):           metadata class representing a set of
                                 (abstract) measurements on entities from an
                                 object type, that take their abstract
                                 observations, or their values, from a
                                 phenomenon (including subslasses), a measure
                                 (including subclasses), or a representation.
                                 Examples: 'main economic activity of a
                                 business', 'age of a person', 'well-being of a
                                 person'
    DatasetDesign(Element):      metadata class representing an ordered list of
                                 variables that are 'connected through a common
                                 object type'. Examples: 'age and income of a
                                 person', 'composition and income of a
                                 household'
    Quantity(Phenomenon):        a quantity in the scientific sense,
                                 irrespective of the unit of measure. Examples:
                                 'length', 'mass', 'energy'
    Measure(Type):               abstract metadata class for recording the way
                                 a variable is measured, given either by a unit
                                 of measure, a code list or a level
    Unit(Measure):               metadata class for supplementing a (n
                                 abstract) variable that has a quantity as a
                                 codomain, with a unit of measure. Examples:
                                 'meter', 'microgram', 'joule'
    CodeList(Measure):           metadata class for supplementing a (n
                                 abstract) variable that has an arbitrary
                                 phenomenon as a codomain, with a finite set of
                                 categories, which act as the 'observables' for
                                 the variable: the values that the variable can
                                 take. Examples: 'combination of NACE level 1
                                 and level 2', 'the 'male', 'female' and
                                 'total' categories'
    Level(CodeList):             metadata class for recording a special kind of
                                 code list: categories in a level must be
                                 mutually disjoint. Examples: 'Nace level 2',
                                 'the 'male and 'female' categories'
    Representation(Type):        metadata class for recording technical aspects
                                 of observed data, such as the format of the
                                 data, or the data type. Examples: 'yyyymmdd',
                                 '32 bits integer'
    ObjectTypeInclusion
        (ObjectTypeRelation):    represents the inclusion of one object type
                                 into another. Examples: 'male->person
                                 inclusion', 'financial business->business
                                 inclusion'
    DatasetDescription(Element): metadata class for recording information about
                                 a single data set. Examples: 'income and age
                                 of a person (Jan.1 2010, All working persons)'
    PhenomenonMeasureMapping
        (Element):               metadata element for associating a phenomenon
                                 with a measure: this expresses that the
                                 measure provides meaningful extra information
                                 to the phenomenon. Examples: 'length->meter
                                 mapping', 'economic activity->Nace level 1
                                 mapping'.
    MeasureRepresentationMapping
        (Element):               metadata element for associating a
                                 representation with a measure: this expresses
                                 that the measure can be meaningfully
                                 supplemented with information from the
                                 representation. Examples: 'date->yyyymmdd
                                 mapping', 'meter->32 bit integer mapping'
    Constant(Element):           expresses that a value has a certain type.
                                 Examples: 'August 5, 2010' (as a value of type
                                 'date'), '2040' (as a value of type 'euro')
    One(Type):                   singleton class, the only instance of which
                                 represents an arbitrary, but fixed, set with
                                 one member
    Operator(Element):           Not implemented yet

Exception classes:
    InvalidKind(Exception): instances of InvalidKind are raised when an attempt
                            is made to construct an invalid Kind instance. See
                            the __init__() member functions of the Type and
                            Element classes for the conditions under which an
                            InvalidKind instance is raised.

Module level instances:
    one (One): represents an arbitrary, but fixed, set with one member and is
               used, e.g., as the domain of a Constant

Note: use the kind Python module in combination with the term Python module.
See the code at the bottom of this module for code examples, or or execute
this code by importing the kind module in a Python console.
