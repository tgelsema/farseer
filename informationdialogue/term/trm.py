"""The term Python module exposes a number of classes and functions that can be
used in the creation of a term, from Kind instances (see the kind Python
module) and Gap instaces (these act as 'variables' in a Term) and from the
Application of an Operation to a list of other Term instances. In this way, a
Term instance can be built up from other Term instances recursively.

The term module also exposes concrete Operation classes, and instances of these
classes. Only the latter should be used, since concrete Operation classes
should be treated as singleton classes: they have one instance only. The term
Python module also exposes these instances.

Each of the concrete classes derived from Operation represents an operation,
that can be applied (through an Application) to a number of arguments. Concrete
Operations can be split into two: those that, in an Application, return a Term
that is a 'type' (Selection, CartesianProduct and FunctionalType) and those
that return an 'element' (Composition, Product, Inclusion).

Functionality is added to each concrete Operation class for checking whether or
not an Application of an Operation instance to a number of Term instances is
valid or not.

Functionality is added to each concrete Operation class for returning a return
type, if the operation returns an element: the return type is then the
functional type of the element (i.e., its 'domain' and 'codomain' can be
inspected from the functional type).

Functionality for translating a Term instance to some form of xml is also
provided, as well as the opposite: the creation of a Term from an appropriate
xml structure.

class Term:
    """Abstract class for the Kind (Types and Elements), Gap, and Application
    classes.

    A Term instance is either a Kind instance, a Gap instance or an Application
    instance. A Gap instance acts as a 'hole' in a Term. An an Application
    instance must be used (recursively) to build larger Terms from smaller
    ones.

    A Term instance always reflects either the structure of a 'type' (i.e., the
    way the 'type' is build from other 'types' or 'elements') or the structure
    of an 'element' (i.e., the way the 'element' is built from other 'elements'
    or 'types') . In the latter case, the 'element' is associated with a
    functional type, which is the Application of the functional type operator
    to the 'domain' and 'codomain' of the element.
    
    The use of an Application is bound by certain rules; in fact, some of these
    rules constitute a type system for Term instances, in case these instances
    reflect 'elements'. Hence, for instance, an Application of the composition
    operator to a number of 'elements' is allowed only if these elements form a
    'path', where the 'codomain' of an element equals the 'domain' of the next
    (see the documentation of the Operator class).

    Attributes:
        kind (str):  equals either 'element' or 'type'
        sort (str):  the name of an actual (non abstract) Kind instance (like
                     'object type' or 'variable') or a Gap instance. Equals
                     'None' if the Term instance is an Application instance.
        type (Term): the structure of the type of a Kind, Application or Gap
                     instance. Equals 'None' if kind is 'type' and is optional
                     if kind is 'element'

        kind (list): the list ['type', 'element']
